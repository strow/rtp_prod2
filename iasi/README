IASI RTP Subset Production Scripts

Designed to process a calendar month of days of one type of subsetting at a time.
Can be run on a single day by executing script 'run_iasi_rtp.m' given a file with
the required date only. In this mode, the slurm job also has to be submitted manually.
Or can be run on a single IASI granule by manually running 'create_iasi_rtp.m' with a
single granule file and subset string. In this mode also, the slurm job has to be
submitted manually (or run as an interactive matlab session).

NB. Currently RTP files are written to: /asl/s1/chepplew/projects/iasi/rtpprod/.
This is hard wired in create_iasi_rtp.m.

The assumption is that these scripts are run in the 'iasi' sub-directory of git-repo or
cloned rtp_prod2/iasi/, as this determines the path definitions for dependent and child
procs. Once the paths.m routine is executed, the session will be in the run/ sub-directory.

Control Flow:
-------------

1. start with: batch_iasi_rtp.m

For monthly subset processing, 2 paramaters. 
   Parameter 1: month. Format: string in single quotes: 'YYYY/MM'.
   Parameter 2: subset type. One of the following ('clear','random','center','dcc','sites')

Creates a matlab file containing the list of days of the month to process and a
slurm script in the current directory with the appropriate sbatch settings,
and executes the slurm job, with parent script 'run_iasi_rtp.m'.

The heirarchy of scripts is as follows: 
  batch_iasi_rtp.m calls ./run_iasi_rtp.m, which calls ./create_iasi_rtp.m which
  calls in sequence; ./iasi2rtp.m,  grib/fill_era.m, util/rtpadd_usgs_10dem.m, 
    emis/rtpadd_emis_single.m.
  It will then subset according to the option chosen: 
  
  option random: calls random_eq_area.m
  
  option (fixed) sites: calls fixedsite.m
  
  option center: simple subsets using subset_rtp.m
  
  option clear: calls imager_uniformity.m, spctral_uniformity.m, spectral_clarity.m
  and then after running klayers and sarta, calls iasi_clear_wn.m.
  
  option dcc: simply subsets according to brightnes temperature thresholds on three 
  channels.


2. start with: run_iasi_rtp.m
   The pre-requisite is that there is a date file with the date to process called 
   'iasi_rtp_drv.mat'. The job MUST be run on an HPC compute node from the command
   line, the script will test for this and select the first entry from the date file.
   There are 2 paramaters: Paramater 1: is the name of the date mat file.
   Paramater 2: is the subset option string.

3. start with: create_iasi_rtp.m
  There are 2 input parameters: 
    Parameter 1: the IASI granule file, with full absolute path.
    Parameter 2: the subset string.
  In this mode it is recommended to run on a compute node in an interactive matlab session.
